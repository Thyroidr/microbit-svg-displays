# microbit-svg-displays
Uses an SVG of the microbit from https://github.com/microbit-foundation/microbit-svg and a python script to create images of the microbit showing arbitrary pixel displays.

Credit to https://github.com/microbit-foundation/microbit-svg for the original SVG.

To use, simply edit the `config.txt` file and run the python script. It will generate an `output.svg` file.
