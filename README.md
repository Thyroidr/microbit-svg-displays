# microbit-svg-displays
Uses an SVG of the microbit from https://github.com/microbit-foundation/microbit-svg and a python script to create images of the microbit showing arbitrary pixel displays.

Credit to https://github.com/microbit-foundation/microbit-svg for the original SVG.

To use, simply edit the `config.txt` file and run the python script. It will generate an `output.svg` file.

Put the brightnesses in the following order:
0 5 10 15 20
1 6 11 16 21
2 7 12 17 22
3 8 13 18 23
4 9 14 19 24
